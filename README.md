# Ai-Project-Tic-Tac-Toe
Python is a high-level, interpreted and general-purpose dynamic programming language that
focuses on code readability. The syntax in Python helps the programmers to do coding in
fewer steps as compared to Java or C++. The Python is widely used in bigger organizations
because of its multiple programming paradigms. They usually involve imperative and object-
oriented functional programming. It has a comprehensive and large standard library that has
automatic memory management and dynamic features.
Our project is to implement the Tic-Tac-Toe game which will features like single player and
two player modes. In single player mode we have used game theory logics like minimax
algorithms to determine the best move that the computer plays.The project was tested and it
turned out to be muchÂ accurate.
